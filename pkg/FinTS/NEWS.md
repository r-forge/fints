# Changes in Version 0.4-9

- removed package 'distrEx' from 'Suggests'.

- fixed 'inst/scripts/ch01.R' to not throw error if a package needed for an
  example is not installed.


# Changes in Version 0.4-8

- fixed CRAN NOTEs 'Lost braces in \itemize; meant \describe ?'.
  

# Changes in Version 0.4-7

- 'FinTS-package.Rd' contained hard coded strings related to old versions of
  FinTS (now they are computed at build time) and removed the table repeating
  stuff from file DESCRIPTION.
    
- a number of minor edits and corrections in most Rd files.


# Changes in Version 0.4-6

- New maintainer - Georgi N. Boshnakov.

- The URL in file DESCRIPTION had become inaccessible, the current one is
      http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey.tsay/teaching/fts2/.

  However, I (GNB) think that this should be the development page of the
  package, so I changed it to https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/fints/.


# Changes in Version 0.3-7

- Added "See Also: 'file.path'" to the help file for 'package.dir' to make it
  easier to find.


# Changes in Version 0.3-6

- This is the first version to have a complete script for chapter 9.  The
  previous release had complete scripts for chapters 1-3 and partial scripts for
  chapters 4, 9, and 11.
